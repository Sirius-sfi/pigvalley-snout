# Pig Valley Snout

An experiment on dynamic multi attributed outcrop model visualization using point sets.

# Build and run

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org) and a browser with good WebGL support. Uses parcel to bundle it all up into the dist folder.

```
clone https://github.com/Sirius-sfi/pigvalley-snout.git
cd pigvalley-snout
npm install
npm start
```

Then point to favorite browser to:
```
http://localhost:1234/
```

(if your favorite browser is Lynx, you might be out of luck)
